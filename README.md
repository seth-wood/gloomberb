## Desktop App or TUI?

Gloomberb has two ways in:

| Surface | Best for | How it runs |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Desktop app | A polished app window, pop-out panes, OS shortcuts, and built-in updates | Published for macOS and Windows. It also installs a `gloomberb` terminal command for the TUI. |
| Terminal UI | Fast keyboard workflows inside your terminal, SSH/dev boxes, Linux machines, and script-friendly setups | Runs with `gloomberb` on macOS, Linux, and Windows. |
| Browser app | The shared DOM interface without an install | Open [term.gloom.sh](https://term.gloom.sh). |

The desktop app and TUI share the full command language and plugin system. The browser app uses the same official DOM renderer and layout with a reviewed browser plugin catalog.

## Browser App

[term.gloom.sh](https://term.gloom.sh) works anonymously with configuration, tickers, layouts, session state, and plugin state stored in the browser. Gloom Cloud login is optional and enables cloud-backed market data, chat, and sync. Cloud REST and WebSocket traffic goes directly to `https://api.gloom.sh`; the static host never receives Gloom credentials.

The browser build intentionally omits brokers and native integrations, filesystem notes, local AI, external plugins, updater/debug tools, application menus, native window controls, pop-out native windows, and native context menus. Modules that still depend on desktop-only or CORS-blocked feeds are also absent for now: RSS/Substack, prediction markets and polls, market halts/heatmap/movers, dividend/ownership/SEC panes, earnings/IPO, and TV. Public shares open under `/s/:id` in a separate slim bundle. Share creation and owner deletion use the signed-in Gloom Cloud session directly on the API; public reads require no account.

Local browser development:

```bash
bun run web:build
bunx wrangler dev
```

Validate the public artifacts with `bun run web:audit` and `bun run cloudflare:dry-run`. `wrangler.jsonc` is intentionally generic and contains no account, route, domain, namespace, or secret. Production routing and the private Gloom Cloud API deployment are configured separately.

## Install

### macOS

Install the desktop app and the `gloomberb` terminal command:

```bash
brew install --cask vincelwt/tap/gloomberb
# or
curl -fsSL gloomberb.com/install | bash
```

Both install `Gloomberb.app` and a `gloomberb` command that runs the TUI through the app bundle, so the bundled runtime is stored once.

Prefer a direct download?

- [Download Gloomberb for Mac](https://gloomberb.com/download/desktop)

### Linux

Install the standalone TUI binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL gloomberb.com/install | bash
```

This installs `gloomberb` to `~/.local/bin` by default. A Linux desktop package is not published yet.

### Windows

Install the desktop app:

- [Download GloomberbSetup.exe for Windows](https://github.com/gloom-sh/gloomberb/releases/latest/download/stable-win-x64-GloomberbSetup.exe)

The installer supports Windows 11 on x64 and ARM64. On ARM64, the desktop app and its bundled `gloomberb` terminal command use Windows' built-in x64 emulation.

For a terminal-only setup on x64, install Bun and use the package:

```powershell
bun install -g gloomberb
```

### Terminal Package

Already have Bun installed on any supported OS?

```bash
bun install -g gloomberb
```

Then run:

```bash
gloomberb
```

On macOS and Windows, desktop updates replace the installed app in place and keep the terminal command pointing at the updated runtime. Homebrew users can also update through `brew upgrade --cask gloomberb`.

For the best terminal experience, use a [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)-compatible terminal such as Ghostty, Kitty, or WezTerm.

Live TV in the terminal also requires `mpv` with Kitty video output. Gloomberb resolves the stream in JavaScript and runs `mpv` with its `yt-dlp` integration disabled, so `yt-dlp` is not required.

## Start

Open command mode with `Ctrl+P`, then type a command. Press `` ` `` to open ticker search directly.

| Try | Opens |
|-----|-------|
| `DES AAPL` | Security details |
| `GP NVDA` | Price chart |
| `G AAPL:price, MSFT:revenue` | Mixed-series chart |
| `TOP` | Ranked market stories |
| `HM` | Market heatmap |
| `MOST` | Market movers |
| `HILO` | New highs and new lows |
| `PF` | Portfolios and watchlists |
| `KELLY AAPL` | Position sizing |
| `HELP` | Full in-app shortcut list |

## What It Does

- Research companies with quotes, charts, financials, filings, holders, insiders, options, analyst ratings, events, and relative valuation.
- Follow markets with top stories, breaking news, sector feeds, Substack subscriptions, global indices, futures, FX, macro events, yield curves, Treasury auctions, market movers, new-high/new-low and options-flow scanners, and fear/greed.
- Track portfolios and watchlists, connect brokers, set alerts, keep notes, run AI screens, browse prediction markets, and use Gloom Cloud chat.

### Broker position sync

Use **New Portfolio** or **Add Broker Account** to connect a broker. Gloomberb can import positions from Interactive Brokers, Public, Robinhood, and SimpleFIN.

- Robinhood opens a browser sign-in page. Gloomberb uses only the read-only account and equity-position tools from the Robinhood Trading MCP server.
- Public needs an API secret from Public API settings. Gloomberb creates a short-lived access token and uses only the account and portfolio endpoints.
- SimpleFIN needs a one-time setup token from SimpleFIN Bridge. Gloomberb exchanges the token and imports only accounts that contain holdings.

Gloomberb saves the connection data on the local device. It does not include this data in Gloom Cloud synchronization. A later position sync updates the managed portfolios and removes positions that the broker no longer reports.

## CLI

Running `gloomberb` with no arguments launches the terminal UI. Normal commands run through a headless CLI path; use `gloomberb launch-ui` when a script should explicitly open the UI.

Human-readable output is the default. Automation can opt into structured output with `--json`, `--csv`, or `--ndjson`. JSON output favors the richest fetched model available and includes display-column metadata when a command has table columns; CSV and NDJSON use the command's tabular row view. Common global flags include `--limit`, `--refresh`, `--quiet`, `--no-color`, `--dry-run`, and `--yes`.

Commands that need a signed-in cloud session may return `auth_required`; sign-in, account management, and chat workflows are still handled in the app UI for now.

## Plugins

Everything from the portfolio list to broker integrations is a plugin. Plugins can add panes, tabs, columns, command bar commands, CLI commands, status bar widgets, and data providers.

Core plugin areas include:

- Portfolios, watchlists, manual entry, and broker connections
- Ticker details, quotes, charts, options, filings, holders, insiders, and research
- News, Substack reader feeds, market movers, global indices, sectors, FX, earnings, macro data, and yield curves
- Prediction markets, alerts, notes, chat, AI screeners, and external plugins

See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for the plugin API and the shared UI surface available through `gloomberb/components`.

## Command Reference

Use `HELP` inside Gloomberb for the live shortcut list. The common command-bar prefixes are listed here for quick scanning.

### Chart Composer

`G`, `GP`, `GIP`, `CMP`, `GF`, and `GE` all open the same chart composer with different starting presets. `CAT` opens a searchable catalog of those chartable series so you can graph one without typing the expression. A custom expression can mix unrelated data sources on one synchronized timeline:

```text
G AAPL:price, MSFT:revenue, FRED:CPIAUCSL
```

Open **Series** to add, remove, reorder, or hide series and choose each series' field, chart style, transform, axis, panel, period, and panel scale. Price data supports candles, OHLC, HLC, line, and area; scalar data supports its compatible line, area, step, column, and point modes. Panels can use independent left/right axes and linear or logarithmic scales.

The toolbar controls preset or exact date ranges, intervals from one minute through monthly, the primary chart mode, technical indicators, and pair formulas. Indicators include volume, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD; formulas include ratio, spread, and rolling correlation. Mixed-frequency values use as-of alignment: fundamentals use filing dates when available, sparse series carry forward only after becoming available, and missing publication dates are called out in the chart status.

## Gloom Cloud sign-in

Sign in with email and password, or pick `Log In with QR Code` from the command bar and scan the code with the Gloomberb mobile companion app to sign the terminal in without typing. The onboarding wizard offers the same QR option as the recommended path, with email and password as the alternative.

## Localized interface

Gloomberb includes English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean UI support. English remains the default fallback language.

- **Automatic detection:** supported `LANG` / `LC_ALL` and desktop system locales select the matching interface automatically.
- **Command switching:** enter `LANG` in the command bar (Ctrl+P) to cycle languages, or use `LANG auto`, `LANG en`, `LANG es`, `LANG zh-CN`, `LANG zh-TW`, `LANG ja`, or `LANG ko`. The choice is persisted in `config.json`.
- **One-run override:** `GLOOMBERB_LANG=ja gloomberb` (or another supported locale) takes highest priority in environments that expose process locale variables.

Implementation notes:

- Locale dictionaries live in [src/i18n](src/i18n), keyed by the original English UI text. Missing entries safely fall back to English.
- Shared render sinks call `t()` / `tf()` / `tc()` for pane titles, the command bar, menus, settings, tabs, help, and onboarding.
- Finance abbreviations such as BID, ASK, and CHG% intentionally remain in English for terminal conventions and fixed-width alignment.
- CJK wide characters and grapheme clusters are measured by [src/utils/format.ts](src/utils/format.ts) using terminal display-cell widths.
